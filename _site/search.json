    "text": "Independent Research supervised by UCLA Faculty\ndata analytics, October 2024 - current\n\n\nResearch Overview\nI am conducting research to evaluate decision-making processes in law enforcement and artificial intelligence, with a focus on understanding potential biases. This study aims to compare how law enforcement professionals and an AI system analyze fictional criminal case files, assessing decision accuracy, confidence, and underlying biases while maintaining a controlled and neutral study environment.\nParticipants, including law enforcement professionals such as police officers and detectives, review anonymized fictional case files featuring varied suspect demographics. Simultaneously, a specialized AI system analyzes the same cases under identical conditions. Both human participants and the AI are tasked with identifying the most likely suspect and assigning confidence scores to their decisions, with all case files randomized to minimize order effects.\nTo ensure unbiased behavior, the study conceals its focus on bias, presenting itself as an evaluation of decision-making tools and strategies. Statistical analysis will compare human and AI performance, focusing on differences in suspect selection and confidence while examining how factors such as demographic variables influence decisions.\nThis research explores the broader implications of integrating AI in decision-making processes, particularly in high-stakes fields like law enforcement. By identifying patterns of bias and assessing the potential of AI to reduce such biases, this study aims to contribute to fairer and more accurate decision-making frameworks, bridging the gap between human expertise and technological innovation."

    "text": "Independent Research supervised by UCLA Faculty\ndata analytics, October 2024 - current\n\n\nResearch Overview\nI am conducting independent research under the mentorship of UCLA faculty, Dr. Vivian Lew, in collaboration with Tranquility-AI Cybersecurity International and Professor Marta D’Elia. My work explores the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in the analysis of legal documents, with a focus on advancing efficiency and accuracy in the fields of criminal justice and public safety.\nThe research investigates the comparative performance of AI systems and legal professionals in processing complex case materials. Specifically, it examines differences in speed, comprehension, and accuracy when reviewing legal documents and answering associated questions. This includes assessing whether AI can achieve similar or superior levels of performance compared to human expertise, thereby identifying areas where AI could support or complement traditional legal workflows.\nBeyond performance metrics, the project addresses broader considerations, such as the ethical and practical implications of integrating AI into legal practices. Key challenges include ensuring fairness and transparency in AI decision-making, maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive information, and understanding how technology can be optimally utilized to support legal professionals without replacing their nuanced judgment and expertise.\nThis research contributes to the growing intersection of technology, data analytics, and the legal profession by offering insights into how AI can streamline time-intensive processes, enhance productivity, and improve accessibility to justice. Ultimately, the findings aim to inform policy development and guide the adoption of AI-driven solutions in legal and public safety domains, fostering innovation while upholding the principles of fairness and accuracy."

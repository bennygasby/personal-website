With a deep interest in the power of data to inform decision-making, I am eager to apply my statistical expertise to real-world challenges. My goal is to transition this knowledge into practical applications, particularly as a consultant, where I can help businesses and organizations leverage data-driven strategies for growth and innovation. I am dedicated to continuous learning and excited about the opportunity to make meaningful contributions through analytical thinking and impactful solutions.
